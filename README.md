# Animal crossing GCN HD Textures

This project targets to provide HD texture to the original Animal Crossing published on GameCube. 

Since **Techie Android** made a wonderful work available [here](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-uhd-animal-crossing-gc-texture-project), we are only trying to propose textures that are not already contained in his pack, in order to ask him to integrate them. 

## How to participate 

1) Download the original pack [here](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-uhd-animal-crossing-gc-texture-project)

2) Install it (See custom texture with Dolphin emulator)

3) Download this repo

4) Install the files located in the "Final" folder 

3) Find what is missing 

4) Draw vector graphics (.svg) following the  **Techie Android**'s style guidelines (using Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator). Vector graphics can be upscaled without limit, and they work really well with version control ! (Since .svg is just text)

5) Make a PR ! :D

## TODO

* Redraw Lola's "sad" mouth textures
